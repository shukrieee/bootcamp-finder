TK2 Academy’s mission is to transform the lives of our students through the power of computer education. 
Whether your goal is to develop a new skill set, get a jump start on higher education or undergo a complete career change, 
we believe in harnessing the gifts of each student to unfold their potential. 
Our students are engineers, artists, journalists, entrepreneurs, financial analysts, folks just out of college and your new best friend.

Located in the heart of Boca Raton, we offer web immersive, iOS and Android development courses. 
While programming literacy is our school’s primary focus, 
our courses are built to develop both the individual’s programming and business skills for ease of integration into the real world
post-graduation. We capitalize on an extensive network of partnering companies and career resources to find alumni jobs 
or guide them through the process of entrepreneurship. Simply put, our students graduate ready to take on the world.
