The Master SQL Server Developer program includes coverage of relational database fundamentals, SQL programming, Reporting Services, Integration and Analysis Services as well as coverage of ASP.NET Web forms.  

Courses can be taken either face-to-face in the classroom or via remote attendance. Remote attendance connects students to a live classroom presentation that includes a mix of in-person and remote students. You decide which courses to attend in person or remotely. All programming courses include at least 50% of time performing comprehensive hands on exercises facilitated by expert instructors. This boosts retention and confidence as well as assuring competency with the new skills being acquired.

The price point for our bootcamps is significantly less than the cost of other programs that have little or no live presentation or hands-on component. Our self-directed scheduling allows you the flexibility you require to complete your training in the time frame you need.

We invite you to examine our detailed curriculum descriptions and compare them to other bootcamp sites. We have no sales representatives. Registrars are available at 978.250.4983 to answer any questions you may have regarding the programs of interest to you. We will assist you with remote attendance preparations, scheduling, explanation of program electives or any other requests for information you may have
