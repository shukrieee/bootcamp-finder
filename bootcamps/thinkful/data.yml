description: !!python/unicode 'Thinkful''s Web Development Bootcamp combines an in-depth,
  project-based approach with three 1-on-1

  sessions every week. This program is built to land beginners their first

  developer job without having to quit their existing one like all offline

  programs. In this fully online program you''ll work side-by-side with a

  professional developer building interactive websites and apps. Your mentor

  will customize each phase of the course, so you can learn other JavaScript

  frameworks and build advanced capstone projects from scratch. You''ll also gain

  valuable real-world experience working in a team setting as you collaborate

  with other students over GitHub and Slack.


  The Bootcamp can be taken at two paces: Full Time or Flexible.


  The Flexible Web Development Bootcamp is unique among bootcamps, in that it achieves
  the same end goals while remaining compatible with students'' normal job schedules.
  In the Full Time Web Development Bootcamp, Thinkful students spend all day learning
  for 17 weeks straight. At this level of immersion, students require constant support,
  and are surrounded by a team of instructors, TA''s, 1-on-1 mentors, as well as their
  classmates.


  In select cities, Thinkful leverages local networks to match students with mentors
  at top companies in their area. Currently, students in [Raleigh](https://www.thinkful.com/raleigh-tech-talent-pipeline/)
  and [Atlanta](https://www.thinkful.com/atlanta-tech-talent-pipeline/) can attend
  Thinkful-sponsored meetups and get an early beachhead into both cities'' tech markets.


  Thinkful provides scholarships to all self-identifying women and military veterans
  of $100 per month for Flexible Web Development Bootcamp students and $200 per month for Full Time Web Development students. The school provides
  these in collaboration with Girl Code It, MotherCoders, and Operation Code. The
  women''s scholarship can be redeemed [using this link](https://www.thinkful.com/join/sign-up?course_code=FEWD-201&scholarship=women-scholarship-100)
  and the veteran''s scholarship [can be redeemed here](https://www.thinkful.com/join/sign-up?course_code=FEWD-201&scholarship=veterans-scholarship-100).

      \ in-depth, project based approach of the Flexible pace. The main difference\
      \ is that the Full Time pace pushes students to become web developers in 17\
      \ weeks and requires over 40 hours of effort per week. The fully online program\
      \ features constant support, as students interact with their classmates, instructors,\
      \ and mentors. Each student has a dedicated mentor, who they meet with daily\
      \ 1-on-1 for half an hour.\n\nThe course teaches students full-stack JavaScript\
      \ and features a \u201Cflex week,\u201D in which students learn different technologies,\
      \ including Ruby and Python. Students also use industry-standard collaboration\
      \ tools such as GitHub and Slack.\n"
