Hack Reactor been an awesome experience and I couldn't recommend it highly
enough. I graduated from Hack Reactor in early November as one of the 29
students in the 6th cohort, which started in August 2013. As a testament to
just how great and effective Hack Reactor is, by the end of the 2nd week after
graduation, I already started getting job offers with 6-figure salaries. The
statistics on their webpage aren't kidding around. At the time that I applied,
they bragged about the average graduate getting $85k salaries. I was already
skeptical of that at the time that I applied (but it was still a lot better
than what I earned before). After we've graduated, as other students in my
cohort got offers, it became apparent that the average salary has been
increasing with each cohort and a 6-figure salary was the new norm. What sets
Hack Reactor apart from the other immersive schools out there, like Dev
Bootcamp and App Academy? There's a few things: 1. Most other schools teach
students Ruby on Rails (a server-side language), while Hack Reactor focuses on
teaching students software engineering principles using JavaScript, a (often
client-side) language used by virtually every online presence out there.
Because of its ubiquitous nature, there's a lot more demand for JavaScript
engineers on the job market. 2. At 12 weeks long (technically 13 weeks, more
on that later), 11 hours a day (I stayed 13), and 6 days a week, you're
investing a lot more time into the program. This means you're more thoroughly
immersed in the curriculum and you get to spend 3.5 weeks on developing
awesome projects: one to show off what you can do on your own, and one amazing
one to show off what you can accomplish as part of a team. Both of these
projects give you the opportunity to demonstrate what you're capable of doing,
once you start applying for jobs. 3. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention cost.
Hack Reactor (at the time of this review) costs $17,780. That's a hefty chunk
of change, but it's easily the best investment I've ever made. The salary
difference between my job prior to Hack Reactor and afterwards more than makes
up for the cost of tuition. Also, if you wished Hack Reactor did something
akin to App Academy, where they garnish 18% of your first year's salary,
consider this: 18% of the average Hack Reactor graduate's salary (which at the
time of this writing is $110k) comes out to $19,800, which is even more
expensive! Hack Reactor also does a great job of screening applicants for
culture fit. Every student comes into HR because they genuinely want to learn
to build applications and tackle new challenges; they're not just there
because they heard that HR graduates make a lot of money. Once you're in the
program, you're surrounded by people who are just as driven and inspired as
you are, and it encourages you to do even better. After the group projects are
done, HR kicks off the job search period by hosting a Hiring Day event where
they invite recruiters from various companies (including Salesforce, Yahoo,
Pandora, Udacity, Inkling, and Walmart Labs) and students get to talk to each
company for 5 minutes, speed-dating style (because if you think about it, job
searching is really similar to dating, in the sense that both parties are
looking for the best fit and determining if they can make the relationship
work). From this day on, HR helps you with all aspects of the job search, from
boosting your online profile and resume, to one-on-one practice
interview/whiteboarding sessions, reaching out to give you advice on each step
of the way. This is probably the most underrated part of Hack Reactor, but
it's crucial to its success, because college career services don't offer
anywhere near this level of personal support after you graduate. Of course,
Hack Reactor isn't without its flaws. The main issue: class sizes are starting
to exceed capacity, and they currently don't have enough physical space and
staff to deliver the full level of support they're aiming to provide (which
includes very limited restroom stalls, which meant waiting in line for a few
minutes after lectures). At least, they didn't when I was there, but I've
heard plans that they've acquired another floor in the same building, with
plans to use it in early 2014, and they're constantly hiring more staff to
deal with their growth. I took a gamble when I decided to attend Hack Reactor,
a program that none of my peers had ever heard of, let alone attended. I had
quit my stable, full-time job, drained my entire savings account to pay for
tuition and living expenses, and moved nearly 200 miles to SF. After months of
intense (but rewarding) work, I'm thrilled (and relieved) that it all worked
out in the best way possible and proud to say that going to Hack Reactor was
the best life decision I've ever made. - William N.
