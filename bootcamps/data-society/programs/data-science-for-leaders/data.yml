reviews:
- After successfully completing a project for my client, they requested to double the keywords of the original project. I took the Data Society course to be able to do some of these things on my own and implemented a data-mining project without any partner assistance!
- The information was useful for seasoned data users, but also gives managers with no programming experience a better understanding of analytic approaches and ways to incorporate them in various lines of work.
- I have never read or heard any explanations on data mining techniques as accessible and clear as in the Data Society courses.
