reviews:
- After understanding the logic behind the “Coding Dojo Way” I wholeheartedly believe that I will have no problem learning all of the languages.
- The networking that happens here is invaluable.
- More than specifics of particular languages, the boot camp has taught me what aspects of languages and technologies to prioritize when learning a new language, so picking up new ones on my own will be so much easier later on.
