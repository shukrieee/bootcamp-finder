The Iron Yard is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing code schools. It exists to create real, lasting change for people, companies and communities through technology education. It offers full-time and part-time programs in Back-End Engineering, Data Science, Design, Front-End Engineering and Mobile Engineering (see full course listing below). The Iron Yard has 20 campuses across the U.S.

The Iron Yard launched its first code school campus in Greenville, S.C. in 2013 with two employees and one course offering. In just over two years, the organization has grown into ten course offerings and more than 100 full-time employees.

We work with employers of all sizes in each market where a campus is located. Our comprehensive career support program helps match trained graduates with those employers. We often build our programs and courses for specific locations around employer needs in that specific area.
